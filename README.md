# 🩺 Lung Health Surveillance Dashboard – Analytical Report

## 📘 Introduction

The Lung Health Surveillance Dashboard was created to provide actionable insights into the monitoring of lung cancer patterns within a clinical population. Built using Power BI, the dashboard integrates demographic and diagnostic data to track trends in patient age, gender, and disease prevalence. This report interprets the visual insights captured by the dashboard, helping healthcare professionals, data analysts, and policymakers identify high-risk groups and optimize early intervention strategies.

## 🧮 Summary Statistics

- **Total Patients Surveyed:** 309  
- **Total Lung Cancer Diagnoses:** 270  
- **Lung Cancer Rate:** 87.38%  
- **Average Age of Patients:** 62.67 years  
- **Average Age of Lung Cancer Patients:** 62.95 years

The extremely high detection rate (87.38%) implies a dataset consisting primarily of at-risk individuals, potentially referred due to symptoms or clinical screening programs.

## 🧓 Age-Based Analysis

### Age Distribution
- **50–69 years**: Dominant age group for both general patients and lung cancer diagnoses
- **70+ years**: Second most affected group
- **30–49 years**: Smaller but notable representation
- **Under 30**: Only one diagnosed case

### Lung Cancer Rate by Age
- **70+**: 95.65%  
- **30–49**: 85.71%  
- **50–69**: 85.13%

The data clearly shows that individuals aged 50 and above are at the highest risk and should remain the focus of screening and public health campaigns.

## 🚻 Gender-Based Insights

- **Male Patients**: 147 (47.57%)  
- **Female Patients**: 162 (52.43%)  
- **Lung Cancer Diagnoses by Gender**: Nearly equal among males and females

Despite slightly higher female participation, lung cancer incidence is nearly even across genders, emphasizing the importance of gender-neutral outreach and screening protocols.

## 👥 Cross-Demographic Relationships

The treemap visual "Gender Label by Age Group" confirms that:
- Most diagnoses occur among patients aged 50–69
- Females aged 50–69 represent the largest subgroup with a high number of diagnoses
- Males aged 70+ also show elevated lung cancer prevalence

These patterns support age and gender-segmented educational and intervention strategies in clinical settings.

---

## 📊 Diagnostic Trends

- **Lung Cancer Diagnosed:** 270  
- **Lung Cancer Negative:** 39  
- **Average Pizzas per Order Equivalent (for analogy):** 2.32 (from previous dashboard 😄)

The high positivity rate suggests that the screening or referral process is working well for this high-risk group. However, broader screening among asymptomatic individuals could lower this rate while catching more early-stage cancers.

---

## 🔍 Key Insights

1. **Patients over 50 are most affected**, particularly those in the 50–69 and 70+ age groups.
2. **Both genders are equally susceptible**, highlighting the need for inclusive policies.
3. **Lung cancer rate is extremely high**, likely due to pre-screened symptomatic patient pool.
4. **Only 12.62% of patients were not diagnosed**, indicating accurate targeting or late-stage detection.
5. **Targeted education and screening efforts should focus on middle-aged and elderly populations.**

---

## ✅ Recommendations

- **Intensify Screening for Ages 50+**: Data supports this group as the primary target for ongoing screening and early detection.
- **Gender-Neutral Campaigns**: Both males and females exhibit nearly identical lung cancer rates.
- **Educate at Risk Populations**: Awareness efforts should address risk factors and encourage timely clinical evaluations.
- **Broaden Community-Based Screening**: Including lower-risk populations may help catch more early-stage cases.
- **Monitor Monthly/Quarterly Trends**: Expand the dashboard to track longitudinal changes in response to interventions.

## 📌 Conclusion

The Lung Health Surveillance Dashboard provides a comprehensive view of lung cancer diagnostics within a defined population. It clearly identifies age and gender patterns and supports focused clinical action. With 270 of 309 patients diagnosed, the findings reinforce the importance of proactive screening, particularly among adults aged 50 and above. This tool empowers health organizations to develop data-driven strategies that improve early detection, reduce late-stage diagnosis, and optimize patient care outcomes.
